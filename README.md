# CPSC 312 Project 1

If you are here, you know what this is for.

Libraries are included in the repo.  
However, they will be git ignored for commit/push.  
Please don't make any changes to the libraries.  
  
For the first week, the tasks that are isolated are done in fwt.pl.  
Don't panic if you see warning messages after compiling.

# Note
To import .pl files of name that begins with numerals, do:

	['312-pess'].

To switch Prolog's current working directory, use:

	working_directory(_, CWD).

Example:
	
	working_directory(_, "D:/Git/312/CPSC312Project1").
